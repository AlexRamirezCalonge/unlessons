C Programming Lessons
=====================

This repository holds parts of code developed by people at the GreenLSI group, used here for code review, in order for all of us to improve our C programming skills. 

The repo organization is the following: each folder contains a different lesson, and different versions show how the code has been improved. 

Feel free to browse, comment and ask questions!
